    "# Module 0 - Preparation\n",
    "In this module we will establish the foundational knowledge necessary for our exploration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) in a business context. This module includes an overview of fundamental concepts and techniques in AI and ML, ensuring all participants have a solid understanding of the basics. We will also set up our development environment using Jupyter Notebook, a key tool for our coursework. A brief refresher on Python programming will be provided to ensure proficiency in the language. Additionally, we will delve into the first three chapters of Ethan Mollick's \"Co-Intelligence,\" discussing its key themes and insights related to AI's role in enhancing business intelligence and decision-making processes."

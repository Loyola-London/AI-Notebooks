surplus computers computer auction purchasing warranty
Technology Services runs several surplus equipment auctions per year. Auctions are run online in partnership with Rasmus Auctions. Sales are open to the public, including to Loyola employees and students. Buyers must register through Rasmus and follow their terms and conditions. 
Auctioned equipment consists of items that are no longer usable by the University, typically due to age or changing business needs. All items are sold AS-IS, with no warranty or support from the University. Potential buyers should read descriptions carefully and attend the preview.
We post on ""Loyola Today"" when auctions are available with a link to the bidding site. 
In order to realize the most value for surplus equipment and to be fair to all potential buyers, Technology Services no longer sells equipment directly to employees.

Apple purchasing Personal Technology lenovo computer-loan warranty
Where should I purchase my technology?
Option 1: Buy through a Loyola-affiliated program
Apple, Inc. through the Apple Education Store 
Lenovo through the Lenovo Education Store
Dell through the Dell Loyola University Store
Loyola does not require students to purchase through any affiliate programs, however, discounts may apply through these programs. There is no additional benefit to the student purchasing a laptop through an affiliate program other than a discounted price or promotion. All students, provided that their machine meets the required specifications for support, will receive the same help and attention to their requests for service.
Employees may also take advantage of these discount programs. Additionally, employees may participate in the Technology Loan Program offering financial assistance for your purchase.
Option 2: Buy on your own
There are many stores across the nation that sell all varieties of machines. Although Loyola does not require that students purchase a name-brand machine, we advise that you consider access to support materials for your purchase, in the long run, should you require hardware assistance. Also important to note are the warranty considerations associated with the manufacturer of the machine. The Student Technology Center is not authorized to repair items that are covered under warranty obligations. These issues are stipulated under the contract between you and the manufacturer to be performed by a certified manufacturer technician.

Summary
The Classroom Planning Committee is a group comprised of representatives from Facilities, Technology Services, and Academic Affairs.  This committee maintains a record of academic space upgrades in the areas of technology, facilities, and furniture.  Each fall, the committee meets to establish a priority list of spaces to assess need for upgrades.
Technology Services partners with Academic Affairs for input on the technology needs for the academic spaces.  Quotes for upgraded technology are obtained and submitted for the capital request process.  Upon capital approval, orders are submitted, and installation scheduled accordingly.  User guides are created and added to the Knowledge Base following installation and testing.
Support
Loyola Classroom Technology Training Resources can be found at the following knowledge base article.  Article - Loyola Classroom Technology... (teamdynamix.com)
Process
Anyone with questions or recommendations for classroom technology should contact the help center or work through Academic Affairs to add to the review process.
Technology Services, Facilities, and Academic Affairs meet to review completed upgrades and status of all academic spaces yearly in late Fall.
A priority list is generated for proposed changes for the following fiscal year.
Quotes are generated for the proposed change and submitted for capital request approval.
Based on approved capital, the list of proposed upgrades is refined to meet budget.
Approved upgrades move to purchase orders as needed and scheduling is planned.
Upgrades are completed as scheduled, typically during summer of the new fiscal year, tested, and user guides are created and posted.

Fall and Spring Semesters
HoundPrint credits for students are set to $15 per semester. Your first $15 of printing is funded by Loyola. Any additional amounts in excess of $15 are not. If you exceed your allocated amount, funds will begin to be drawn from your Evergreen account balance at a rate of $.04 per page for black and white printing and $0.12 for color printing. Understanding that you will be charged for any printing that exceeds the allocated amount subsidized by Loyola is important. Each semester, your HoundPrint balance will refresh to $15 for use during that semester only. HoundPrint Credits do not roll over from one semester to another.
Summer Sessions I and II
$15 will be allocated for each summer session. Printing in excess of the allocated amount will result in charges to your Evergreen account balance.
Summer I: Credits will be allocated on or before June 2 every year.
Summer II: Credits will be allocated on or before July 16 every year.
Students NOT enrolled in summer courses: On-campus printing will be charged against your Evergreen account balance at a rate of $0.04 per page for black and white printing and $0.12 for color printing.
Summer Student Employees: A request for HoundPrint credits can be made via email from your supervisor to the OTS Help Center (ots@loyola.edu).
How can I add funds to my Evergreen Account?
Evergreen deposits can be made from the Quick Links section of Inside.Loyola. Additional instructions for adding money to the Evergreen account can be found on Financial Service's webpage.

How to control the document camera
The majority of the classrooms with document camera integration have mobile carts for remote and hybrid teaching, so the document camera will simply appear as the webcam in Zoom on the instructor's station.  
In MH*247, there is a pan/tilt/zoom (PTZ) classroom camera. To toggle between the PTZ and document camera, you can either click ALT+N on the keyboard or click the arrow in the Stop Video button on Zoom and select the USB Video Camera for AverVision Digital Presenter 2. To toggle back to the classroom camera, click ALT+N or choose NewTek NDI Video.
You may need to go into Zoom settings and uncheck the Mirror my video setting:
  If the document camera does not appear, you may need to press the CAMERA/PC button on the document camera to tell the camera to connect to the computer. The location of the button is different on different models:

OneDrive Auto Sync Update
In March of 2022, Technology Services is implementing an update to OneDrive that will automatically sync folders on Loyola-issued PCs including employee Desktop, Documents, and Pictures folders. Other folders such as Music, Videos and Downloads are not being automatically synced at this time. This change will retain these folders in the cloud as a backup and give employees access to their files on the go. 
Note: Loyola-issued Macs are not affected by the folder sync at this time. Mac users still have the ability to manually sync specific folders.
What is OneDrive? 
OneDrive is the Microsoft cloud service that connects you to all your files. It allows you to store and protect your files, share them with others, and get to them from anywhere on all your devices. When you use OneDrive with an account provided by your company or school, it's sometimes called ""OneDrive for work or school."" It used to be known as ""OneDrive for Business,"" so you may still see it called that in places.

Currently, XFINITY On Campus does not have an ""XFINITY Stream"" app for the Google Chromecast to stream and watch channels from the XFINITY Stream guide. 
We do recommend purchasing a Roku streaming device so you can using the XFINITY Stream Channel/app to watch Live TV, use DVR, and stream On Demand movies or shows on a traditional flat screen television. For more information, please click here.

However, there are a number of TV Everywhere apps, such as CBS All Access, Watch ESPN, and Watch ABC, to name a few, that XFINITY On Campus students can log in using their school credentials.
Google Chromecast currently has over 30 TV Everywhere apps to stream live TV and On Demand content.
Our help center section about our ""Features"" has more information about TV Everywhere apps and how to login to them using your school credentials.
